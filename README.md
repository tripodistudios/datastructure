# :bar_chart: Data Structures & Algorithms

Data structures can be confusing for beginner programmers! This is an initiative to show the implementation for a data structure visually and through code!

There is already a raft of resources to learn data structures, so why another one?
Because why not? Alright answering a question with another question isn't an answer! We implemented this because other resources were outdated and missing data structures! We wanted to make something aesthetically pleasing and informative! 

This is an ongoing project that has been spun out of Tripodi Studios.

## Acknowledgments

* This project was created out of inspiration from the [University of San Francisco](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html). It is an excellent implementation but we wanted to increase the aesthic appearance and also include code snippets of the actual implementation being used!
